                <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of State today announced the United States’ completion of its withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO) due to the organization's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic that arose out of Wuhan, China, its failure to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.</p>

                <h2>America warns the european nations</h2>
                <p>In January 2026, the United States issued warnings to the European Union regarding escalating trade and territorial disputes. The U.S. stated that the EU's use of its anti-coercion instrument would lead to "natural consequences" and threatened "big retaliation" if European nations divested from U.S. assets. A 10% tariff was announced on several European countries effective February 1, 2026, due to their opposition to American interests in Greenland, and the U.S. also warned that Europe faces "civilizational erasure" and must take responsibility for its own security. More details are available on the source's website.</p>

                <h2>US in big trouble</h2>
                <p>As of early 2026, the United States faces significant, multifaceted challenges including stalling job growth and manufacturing job losses following tariff implementations, rising debt, and intense public backlash against mass deportations. Economic indicators show declining job growth in the second Trump term, with inflation continuing to affect food prices.</p>
