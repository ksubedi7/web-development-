    <h2>SHRI KRISHNA</h2>

    <p>
Shri Krishna is one of the central and most influential figures in the Mahabharat. He was the prince of the Yadava clan and later became the trusted guide and friend of the Pandavas, especially Arjuna. Although Krishna did not directly fight in the Kurukshetra war, his wisdom, leadership, and strategic guidance played a decisive role in the victory of the Pandavas. His most important contribution is the teaching of the Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna on the battlefield, where he explains the meaning of duty, selfless action, devotion, and inner discipline. Through his guidance, Krishna helped the warriors understand their moral responsibilities and encouraged them to act according to righteousness. His role in the Mahabharat represents the power of wisdom, compassion, and ethical leadership.
